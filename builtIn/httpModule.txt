In Node, the http module is a core module that provides functionality to 
create HTTP servers and clients. With this module, you can build web servers 
that handle HTTP requests and send HTTP requests to other servers.

* What can we do with this module?

1. Create HTTP Server
2. Handle Requests
3. Send HTTP Requests
4. HTTP Server Listening

>>> Moving form http to express <<<

Express.js is a web application framework for Node, built on top of the http 
module. While the http module provides basic functionality for creating HTTP 
servers and handling requests, Express.js simplifies and enhances the process 
of building web applications.

* What features we get out of the box in express?

1. Routing 
2. Middlewares
3. Template Engines
4. Error Handling
5. Static File Serving
6. Integration with Third-party Middleware
7. Flexibility is its nature


>>> Expectations out of these modules <<<

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are fundamental in server-side development, 
regardless of the technology stack being used. In the context of Node.

Overall, CRUD operations form the backbone of many Node.js applications, enabling developers 
to build robust, scalable, and maintainable server-side solutions.

* Other alternative to express : 

1. Koa (https://koajs.com)
2. Fastify (https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/HTTP2)
3. Ember js (https://guides.emberjs.com/release/)
