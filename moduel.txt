In Node a module is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates related functionality and can be easily 
imported into other parts of a program. Modules help in organizing code into smaller, 
more manageable pieces and facilitate code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.

There are two types of modules in Node.js:

1. Core Modules: These are built-in modules provided by Node. They can be imported into your code using the 
require function without specifying a path.

2. User-Defined Modules: These are modules created by developers for specific functionalities or tasks. 
User-defined modules can be created by writing JavaScript files containing the desired functionality and then 
exporting it using module.exports or exports object. These modules can then be imported into other files 
using the require function by specifying the path to the module file.
