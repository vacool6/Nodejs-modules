This is a basic express app where we perform CRUD operations on a fake DB. 

Endpoints:

> GET: Retrieving data from server

* http://localhost:8080/products
* http://localhost:8080/product/{product-name}

> POST: Doing something in server

 This would require us to require middleware in order to parse the incoming body.
 app.use(express.json()); // For parsing JSON
 app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // For parsing Form data

 * http://localhost:8080/product
   body : {"name":"","quantity":"","price":""}

> PUT : 
 * http://localhost:8080/product/{id}
   body : {"name":"","quantity":"","price":""}

> DELETE : 
 * http://localhost:8080/product/{id}
